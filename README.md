# food-pantry-website
this is a website i made junior year of high school for a food pantry in chicago.

it is a school project in my honors computer science class. 
everything was made completely from scratch and extremely simplistic.
i worked with a partner on this project but this was my code.

inspiration: make it simple, and friendly. Easy navigation and clearly shown descriptions and images.
Slideshow code waas not my own, however.

languages used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
